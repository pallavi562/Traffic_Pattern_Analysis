# 🚦 Traffic Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Description  
This project analyzes traffic patterns based on various factors such as **time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions**. The goal is to identify peak traffic hours, trends, and correlations to help in **traffic management and urban planning**.

## ✅ Features  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Peak Traffic Hour Analysis  
- Trend Analysis by Day & Time  
- Correlation between Weather and Traffic Volume  
- Interactive Graphs for better visualization  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
